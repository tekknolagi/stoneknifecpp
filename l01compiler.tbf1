( A tiny bootstrap Forth compiler written in itself. -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

Generates an ELF executable for x86 Linux.

Note that this file is Unicode, encoded in UTF-8.  This should be an
upper-case Y with a grave accent mark `: Ỳ.  If that's okay, you can
ignore the following indented paragraph.

    If it appears as a lower-case "a" with an acute accent, followed
    by a right guillemot [looking like ">>"], followed by a
    superscript "2", you are incorrectly interpreting this file as
    ISO-8859-1 or perhaps ISO-8859-15 or Windows-1252.  If it appears
    as a centered dot, followed by a superscript lowercase "a",
    followed by a less-than-or-equal sign, you are incorrectly
    interpreting the file as MacRoman.  If it appears as a capital "A"
    followed by some smoothly joined double lines, you are incorrectly
    interpreting the file as KOI8-R.  If it appears as a German "sz"
    ligature [which kind of looks like the letter "B"] followed by an
    upside-down "L" drawn with double lines and then a sort of
    checkerboard, you are incorrectly interpreting the file as some
    old IBM PC video adapter character set.  If it appears as an "AE"
    ligature, followed by a right guillemot [">>"], followed by a
    dagger [looks like a crucifix], you are incorrectly interpreting
    the file as the old PostScript font encoding.  In any of these
    cases, you have configured your software to be compatible with
    obsolete junk equipment from the 1970s instead of the several
    billion people who live outside of your country, or perhaps it has
    been incorrectly transcoded before you got it.  Hopefully this is
    helpful in diagnosing and fixing the problem.

On the language:

It’s a dumbed-down Forth with no compile-time execution, in which only
the first byte of each word is significant, with some heterodox names
for functions.  Bytes preceded by ' are literals for their numerical
value, e.g. “'A” is 65.

What that means, if you know how to program but don’t know Forth:

Each word of the program is generally a subroutine call.  Words are
separated by spaces.  There are no types. There’s an implicit stack;
words pop their input off the stack and push their output onto it.
Numbers and literal bytes are pushed onto the stack.

So “2 3 + 4 -” calculates 2 + 3 - 4; “2 3 4 + -” calculates
2 - [3 + 4].  “'Z 'A -” calculates the ASCII value of “Z” minus the
ASCII value of “A”, i.e. it calculates 25.  [“+” isn’t in the base
language implemented by the compiler; it’s a user-defined function.
“-” is in the base language.]

“: foo” marks the beginning of a subroutine called “foo”; “;” is the
return instruction.  So “: . %flush u ;” defines a subroutine called
“.” which consists first of calling “%flush”, then calling “u”, then
returning.

“var foo” marks the beginning of a variable named “foo”; the word
“foo” thereafter will push its address onto the stack.  “# 37”
includes the number 37 in the program at that point as a 32-bit
number, so “var X # 0” creates a variable “X” and puts four bytes of
zeroes there.

“@” and “!” fetch from and store to a memory address respectively.  So
“var X # 0 : dup X !  X @ X @ ;” creates a variable X, gives it 32
bits of storage initialized to 0, and defines a subroutine called
“dup”.  “dup” takes whatever is on the stack, stores it in those 32
bits of storage at “X”, then fetches it out of X twice, leaving two
copies of it on the stack.

Combining all of the above, “var HERE # 0 : forward HERE @ + HERE ! ;”
fetches the value at the location “HERE”, adds whatever was on the
stack to it, and stores the result back at “HERE”.

Compile-time primitives:
( — defines a comment that extends to the next right-paren
v — defines a dataspace label, like for a variable.
b — compiles a literal byte, numerically, into data space.
# — compiles a literal four-byte little-endian number into data space.
^ — the location where the program should start executing [everything else
    is just definitions]
space, newline — ignored
: — defines a function
[ — begins a conditional block, which consumes the value on top of the stack
    and is skipped if that value is zero
] — ends a conditional block, matching the latest unmatched [
{ — begins a loop
} — ends a loop — consumes the value on top of the stack and loops back to 
    the matching { if it is nonzero

Run-time primitives:
G — gets a byte from stdin
W — given an address and size on the stack, writes the specified number of 
    bytes to stdout
Q — exits the program with a return code of 0
- — subtracts two numbers.  [Addition isn't a primitive because it’s easy to 
    synthesize from subtraction.]
@ — fetches a word from memory
! — stores to a word in memory whose address is on top of the stack
; — returns from a function
< — a less-than test
m — not used directly since the interpreter doesn’t implement it,
    this invokes an arbitrary system call with up to three arguments.
    The compiler’s implementations of G, W, and Q use this.
s — stores to a byte in memory whose address is on top of the stack

Defined in this file, all necessarily run-time:
h — the ELF header
e — the location of the entry point word in the ELF header
o — the location of the word in the ELF program header that specifies the .ORG
S — the location of the word in the ELF program header that specifies filesize
$ — the start of the area where the program gets compiled
+ — addition
Z — the end of the predefined blob of bytes to output, with slight changes
H — the point where the program is currently getting compiled
f — increases H by its argument
X, Y — two temporary variables
d — DUP
p — DROP
x — SWAP
= — an equality test
> — a greater-than test
D — dispatch a byte being compiled
R — compile the sequence `xchg %ebp, %esp`, buffered by a peephole optimizer
. — add a byte to the program being compiled, flushing the peephole buffer
u — add a byte to the program being compiled, used to implement the peephole 
    buffer
U — the peephole buffer itself, a boolean storing whether there’s a pending 
    `xchg %ebp, %esp`
T — table of types of definitions
A — table of addresses of definitions
F — multiply by four
C — register a Colon definition in the tables
V — register a Variable definition in the tables
a — translate an address from compiler address space to user address space
& — compile a byte if it’s a colon or variable definition
O — boolean OR
N — boolean NOT
w — like G, but skips whitespace
B — a buffer for w
E — stick the item on top of the stack at H as four bytes, advancing H by 4
L — compile code to push the constant on the compile-time stack
t — one step in base-ten decoding: x <- 10x + y
n — parse a number from input and push it on the compile-time stack
J — compile a forward conditional jump [
P — resolve a forward conditional jump ]
j — compile a backwards negative conditional jump }
M — the location in the compiler’s memory for the system call routine

Directory of magic numbers used, other than 0 and 1:
2 — as e_type, means ET_EXEC, an executable file;
    in the T table, means that a user-defined word is a “variable”
3 — as e_machine, means EM_386, Intel 80386;
    the system call number of the `read` system call
4 — the size of a 32-bit word;
    second byte of `sub [%esp], %eax`;
    second byte of `sub %eax, [%esp]`;
    the system call number of the `write` system call
7 — in p_flags, means PF_R | PF_W | PF_X, making the program memory readable, 
    writable, and executable; 
    in random bytes, is the pop %es instruction, which is used to help
    disassemblers resync with the instruction stream
8 — second byte of `movb %cl, [%eax]`;
    2048 / 256
10 — ‘\n’ the ASCII linefeed or newline character
15 — 0F extended opcode prefix byte, used to introduce `setle`, `movsbl`, 
     and `movzbl` instructions, as well as others not used here.
32 — the size of the ELF program header
36 — third byte of `sub [%esp], %eax`;
     third byte of `sub %eax, [%esp]`

89 — `pop %ecx`
90 — `pop %edx`
91 — `pop %ebx`
116 — `jz` instruction, one-byte immediate PC-relative destination
117 — `jnz` instruction, likewise
127 — the first byte of an ELF executable
128 — the interrupt number Linux uses for system calls: 0x80

143 — first byte of `pop [%eax]`, followed by 0
157 — second byte of `setge %al`
184 — `mov $xxx, %eax` — load immediate %eax
192 — second byte of `test %eax, %eax`;
      third byte of `setle %al`;
      third byte of `movsbl %al, %eax`

236 — second byte of `xchg %ebp, %esp`
237 — second byte of `sub $xxx, %ebp`
254 — first byte of `dec %al`
1024 — a table size in bytes: 256 entries of 4 bytes each
4096 — there’s a buffer of this size, which will go away soon.
6144 — 6 * 1024: the offset at which a couple of 1024-byte tables are 
       constructed, ending just before the compiled program itself.
8192 — the offset at which the compiler constructs the compiled program.
131072 — the program runs with its origin at 0x20000. We can't go lower than
         0x10000 on new kernels unless we change the vm.mmap_min_addr sysctl
         parameter. Give ourselves a comfortable margin above that while
         still keeping addresses relatively short.
655360 — the total memory space allocated for the program

Register-use conventions:
`%eax` — the top of the operand stack
`%esp` — normally, points to the rest of the operand stack in memory, in
         the usual `%esp` way: growing downward, predecrement, postincrement.
         Temporarily swapped with `%ebp` during `call` and `ret` instructions.
`%ebp` — normally, points to the return stack in memory, in the usual
         `%esp` way.
`%ecx` — occasionally used as a scratch register
Other registers are only used to pass arguments to Linux system calls.
